## The quickest way to get in touch with me is to:

Email me at [hello@paravsingla.com](mailto:hello@paravsingla.com)

Also, there is no double/blue ticks so I won't feel guilty about seeing your message and not instantly replying.

This website is a work in progress, just like me.

## You might expect...

* a professional blog where I provide tricks and tips about my trade, but you won't find that here.
* a personal blog where I write about my observations and quirks, but you won't find that here either.
* a resume-like website where I list my accomplishments and accolades. Guess what? This ain't that.
* a portfolio to showcase my work. Nope, none of that here.

Well, then you ask, justifiably annoyed, what is this website for? Why would someone buy a domain name, set up a webpage, write all this text for nothing?

## Its not for nothing

Stick with me for a moment. You see, what we're looking at here is the **potential** of this website, not the current situation. Even though that is my name up there, this site could become whatever you want it to be.

You just got to have conviction. Reality can be whatever you want.

### Imagine if this website

* lets you find the original video from a screencap.
* finds the original song from the tune that is stuck in your head.
* automatically organizes your filesystem.
* sends you flowers and a handwritten letter filled with compliments.
* gives you +5 intelligence and +10 luck.

### However, as we know

Reality can be often dissapointing. This website can do none of that.

### But

How sad would it have been..after finding this obscure url, you get curious, your hands couldn't stop themselves from clicking on that link, or you find my email from somewhere and you just had to check out my website, excited by the prospects of finding a diamond in the rough, only to be extremely dissapointed to find out..that the site doesn't exist.

### Nope. Not today.

I want you to be happy today. Also, I provided you something to read so your OCD doesn't spin out of control.
